The work being submitted is my own work - 18th February 2019
SortTest.java - The file does not contain testing of 2^14 and 2^16 size of array as it was 
	not stated in the assignment to test them. Although My code is capable of sorting them.
Gen.java - Changed for macOS (Linux)
Do ignore the warnings, they are not bugs. 
Quick.java - this method is not tested as specified in assignment.
All sort functions were inspired by the textbook "Algorithm"
