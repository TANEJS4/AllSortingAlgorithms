In descending order of performance of different sorting methods:
1. HeapSort
2. MergeTD
3. MergeBU
4. Insertion - binary
5. Insertion - compare
6. Insertion - basic

Explanation: 
Since the Big-O notation of HeapSort and both Merge sort is similar, the output
is as expected, is very similar. difference of 22ms in 2^16 array is size is negligible difference. 
While other sorting methods started to struggle as the array size increased, these 3 sorting methods showed almost
a small a slope. Unlike merge sort, Heap sort does not require massive recursion. Merge sort is supposed 
to be faster for larger sets but requires twice the memory of the HeapSort.
